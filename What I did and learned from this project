Snake, Tank war, and snake is a series projects I did for learning and geting more familiar with Java. Through the three projects, 
I got much more throught understanding of Java programming and object-oriented programming.

In the whole process of developing the tank war game,first I experienced more about what is the object-oriented programming.
In the design phase, I already needed to consider which element or object is necessary for the game. Then my whole developing phase should
base on what I did in the design phase.
Second, when I decided how many and which onjects were necessary for the game, I needed consider what kinds of qualities and functions that
a specific object should own. After that, When I coded for those object, I implemented those qualities and functions to each object and worte
spefici method for them.

The whole development process required me to fully understand what and why I should do this or that for one object. It was a super great
chance for me to understand why the though of object-oriented programming is so important for software developer.

BTW, in tank war game, I also got more familiar with some JAVA API.
I used JAVA.frame to create the user inteface, used the action listener to execute player's common, used container to store objects, used 
the paint method to dram the whole things and etc.

This game gave me lots of fun and the more important thing is the experience I learned from it.
