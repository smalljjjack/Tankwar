In tank war 1.1, I implemented wall function. A wall is an area both player and enemy can not penetrate.
In order to achieve the wall function, I had to rewrite the movement method for both player and enemy. 
Espcially for the enemy, the movement method was hard to write cause its direction was easy to stun to the wall. So i create a very variable
called oldDirection, when the enemy hits the wall, its direction will turn to the oldone and change its position as well.
